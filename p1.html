According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy,
 it is “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.
 Artificial Intelligence is a way to think intelligently of a computer, a computer-controlled robot,
 or a software, in the same way that intelligent humans think.
 Artificial Intelligence is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks and how people learn, decide, 
 and work while trying to solve a problem and 
 then using the results of this study as a basis for the development of intelligent software and systems
 While exploiting the power of the computer systems , human curiosity, leads him to wonder, "Can a machine think and act as human beings do?
 The development of AI thus began with the intention of creating similar intelligence in machines we find and consider high in humans.
